Hi, I’m @Korthal-Maiyn -aka- Christopher Edwards, an enthusiastic IT Professional (Systems Administration / Cloud Infrastructure) with 14+ years’ experience within the IT Industry and a continual learning mindset. 

Lately I've a huge focus on Automation, including DevOps and Agile development workflows for automation scripting, thus why I'm finally trying to utilise a public facing repository as I go. 

Huge proponent of utilising Cloud Technologies (Azure and AWS where my skills lie) and automation where possible. I hope to continue down the path of Automation Engineering by improving my skills and earning certificates where available.
